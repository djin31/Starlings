# Starlings
Simulation of Starlings Murmurations using Boids


## Running the code:
To simply run an out-of-the-box aplication open the relevant application folder and click on the exe or run the executable binary.

To run from the source :
```
You need to have Processing3 installed in your system.
Click on any of the .pde files and run by clicking on play button on top left corner in Processing3 Application.
```
Or to run using command line interface
```
processing-java --sketch=src/starlings --run
```

## Interacting with the simulation:
The user is provided with numerous ways to interact with the simulation and observe corresponding changes and results. They are given the options to:  
1. Adjust the various hyper-parameters used for the simulation with the help of sliders.  
2. Add new boids to the simulation on click of a button. New boids are initialised at random locations.  
3. Increase / Decrease the speed of the boids with keyboard up / down arrows.  
4. Observe various real-time measurements like power, angular momentum and acceleration of the boids while changing parameters.
